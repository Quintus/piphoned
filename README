piphoned
========

piphoned is a SIP client for the Raspberry Pi. My goal is to make this
an implementation good enough to work for my own desktop phone, but it
isn’t finished yet.

Outgoing calls are completely supported already, incoming calls work
most of the time, but not always. The implementation even nominally
supports encryption by means of ZRTP, but I was unable to test it yet
for lack of a ZRTP-capable SIP server.

Dependencies
------------

This is a UNIX daemon and as such requires a UNIX system; due to the
dependency on linphone, most likely Linux is required. It is written
in C, so you also need a C compiler to build it, and additionally, you
need the following external libraries:

* wiringPi
* Linphone, at least version 3.8.0, with ZRTP support enabled

Configuration
-------------

An example configuration file is included in
data/piphoned.conf.sample, as is a sample systemd service file.

Running
-------

Remember this is unfinished software that I only occasionally work
on. It is not recommended to run this if you are not familiar with the
codebase, so please read the sourcecode before you do.

The daemon binary, piphoned, supports the standard “start” and “stop”
commands along with a number of commandline options. Use -h to get a
list of them.
